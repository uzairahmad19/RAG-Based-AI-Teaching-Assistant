# LectureLens - Video RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that turns lecture videos into a searchable, conversational knowledge base. Ask any question about your course and the system tells you exactly which video to watch and at what timestamp.


---

## What It Does

You type a question like *"How does groupby work in pandas?"* and the system:

1. Converts your question into a semantic vector using BGE-M3
2. Searches thousands of lecture transcript chunks using cosine similarity
3. Passes the most relevant chunks to LLaMA 3.2 as context
4. Returns a natural language answer with the exact video title and timestamp

After every query, it automatically evaluates the quality of its own retrieval using **MRR** and **Precision@5**.

## Pipeline Overview

![LectureLens](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f432d5c5-06ff-44de-bb4b-c778dab88a33)



| Stage | File | Tool | What it does |
|-------|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | `process_video.py` | FFmpeg | Extracts audio from `.mp4` lecture files |
| 2 | `create_chunks.py` | Faster-Whisper | Transcribes audio into timed text segments |
| 3 | `merge_chunks.py` | Python | Merges every 5 segments into one larger chunk |
| 4 | `read_chunks.py` | BGE-M3 via Ollama | Embeds each merged chunk into a 1024-dim vector |
| 5 | `app.py` | LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama | Retrieves chunks and generates answers |

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Install the following before running anything:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **FFmpeg** — [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) — must be on your system PATH
- **Ollama** — [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) — runs LLMs locally

Pull the required models through Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull bge-m3
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install faster-whisper flask flask-cors numpy pandas joblib scikit-learn requests
```

### 3. Add your course videos

Download your lecture videos and place all `.mp4` files inside the `videos/` folder:

```
videos/
  Part 1 - Introduction to Pandas.mp4
  Part 2 - DataFrames and Series.mp4
  Part 3 - Data Cleaning.mp4
  ...
```

> **Naming tip:** The pipeline automatically extracts the episode number from filenames that contain `Part`, `Episode`, `Lesson`, or `Ep` followed by a number — e.g. `Part 3`, `Episode 7`, `Lesson 12`. Make sure your filenames follow this pattern.

---

## Running the Pipeline

Run these scripts **once**, in order. After that you only need `app.py`.

### Stage 1 — Extract audio

```bash
python process_video.py
```

Reads every `.mp4` from `videos/`, extracts the audio track using FFmpeg, and saves `.mp3` files into `audios/`.

### Stage 2 — Transcribe

```bash
python create_chunks.py
```

Loads each `.mp3` from `audios/`, transcribes it using Faster-Whisper, and saves timed text chunks as JSON files in `transcripts/`. Each JSON file contains one entry per Whisper segment — these are short, typically 3–8 seconds each.

> ⚠️ This step takes time depending on how many videos you have. On low-end hardware, expect roughly 1–3× real-time (a 30-minute lecture may take 30–90 minutes to transcribe).

### Stage 3 — Merge chunks

```bash
python merge_chunks.py
```

Reads the raw Whisper segments from `transcripts/` and merges every 5 consecutive segments into a single larger chunk, saving the results into `merged_transcripts/`. The merged chunk spans the `start` time of the first segment to the `end` time of the fifth, and combines all their text into one block.

This step exists for two reasons. First, individual Whisper segments are very short and often mid-sentence — they don't contain enough context for the embedding model to understand the topic. Second, fewer but larger chunks means fewer embedding vectors to store and compare, which is important on low-end hardware.

> You can adjust how many segments get merged by changing `n = 5` at the top of `merge_chunks.py`. Higher values produce broader chunks with more context but less precise timestamps; lower values give tighter timestamps but may not capture enough meaning.

### Stage 4 — Generate embeddings

```bash
python read_chunks.py
```

Reads all merged JSON chunks from `merged_transcripts/`, sends each chunk's text to the BGE-M3 model via Ollama to generate a 1024-dimensional embedding vector, and saves everything into `chunks_with_embeddings.joblib`.

> ⚠️ This also takes time on first run. The `.joblib` file is reused on every query after this — you never need to run this again unless you add new videos.

### Stage 5 — Start the API

```bash
python app.py
```

Starts the Flask server on `http://localhost:5000`. Keep this running while using the frontend.

---

## Running the Frontend

Open a second terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

> **VS Code users:** Install the **Live Server** extension by Ritwick Dey, then right-click `index.html` → *Open with Live Server*. It auto-reloads when you save the file.

---

## API Reference

### `POST /query`

Takes a natural language question and returns the LLM-generated answer.

**Request:**
```json
{ "question": "How does groupby work in pandas?" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "answer": "This is covered in Video 5 — GroupBy and Aggregation..." }
```

---

### `POST /evaluate`

Runs retrieval evaluation against a labelled test set and returns MRR and Precision@K.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "query": "How does groupby work?",
      "relevant_keywords": ["groupby", "aggregate", "group"]
    }
  ],
  "top_k": 5
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "num_queries": 1,
  "top_k": 5,
  "mrr": 1.0,
  "precision_at_k": 0.8,
  "per_query": [...]
}
```

A chunk is counted as **relevant** if its text contains any of the `relevant_keywords` (case-insensitive). The frontend automatically extracts keywords from your query and calls this endpoint after every question.

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Formula | What it means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **MRR** (Mean Reciprocal Rank) | `1 / rank_of_first_relevant_chunk` | How highly the first relevant chunk is ranked. 1.0 = always #1 |
| **Precision@5** | `relevant_chunks_in_top_5 / 5` | Fraction of the 5 retrieved chunks that were actually relevant |

**Interpreting scores:**

| Score | MRR | Precision@5 |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| 🟢 Good | ≥ 1.0 | ≥ 0.6 |
| 🟡 Acceptable | ≥ 0.5 | ≥ 0.4 |
| 🔴 Poor | < 0.5 | < 0.4 |

## Low-End Hardware Optimisations

This project was developed and tested on a **low-spec machine**. Several deliberate choices were made to keep it runnable without a GPU or large amounts of RAM:

| Optimisation | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Faster-Whisper instead of original Whisper** | Uses CTranslate2 under the hood — roughly 4× faster on CPU with identical accuracy |
| **int8 quantisation** | `compute_type="int8"` in `create_chunks.py` halves Whisper's memory usage with minimal quality loss |
| **`base` Whisper model** | Chosen over `small`, `medium`, or `large` — accurate enough for clear lecture audio, much faster to run |
| **CPU device mode** | `device="cpu"` in Faster-Whisper — no GPU required |
| **LLaMA 3.2 (3B)** | Smallest capable LLaMA model — runs on 4–6 GB RAM via Ollama without GPU offloading |
| **BGE-M3 via Ollama** | Embedding inference handled locally by Ollama, avoiding any cloud dependency or GPU requirement |
| **Chunk merging (5 segments → 1)** | `merge_chunks.py` groups 5 short Whisper segments into one chunk before embedding — reduces total vector count significantly, lowering both RAM usage and cosine similarity computation time per query |
| **Embeddings pre-computed and cached** | All chunk embeddings are computed once and saved to `.joblib`. Every query loads from disk instantly — no re-embedding on each request |
| **Top-K = 5** | Only the 5 most relevant chunks are passed to the LLM, keeping prompt size and generation time low |
| **Non-streaming generation** | `"stream": False` in Ollama calls — simpler to handle and avoids incremental token overhead on slow machines |

---

## Technologies Used

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Audio extraction | FFmpeg |
| Speech-to-text | Faster-Whisper (`base` model, int8, CPU) |
| Embedding model | BGE-M3 (via Ollama) |
| Language model | LLaMA 3.2 (via Ollama) |
| Similarity search | Cosine similarity (scikit-learn) |
| Backend API | Flask + Flask-CORS |
| Data storage | pandas DataFrame + joblib |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript |

---

## Troubleshooting

**FFmpeg not found**
Make sure FFmpeg is installed and on your system PATH. Test with `ffmpeg -version` in a terminal.

**Ollama connection refused**
Make sure Ollama is running before starting `app.py`. Run `ollama serve` in a separate terminal, or check that the Ollama desktop app is open.

**`chunks_with_embeddings.joblib` not found**
You need to run all four pipeline scripts in order (`process_video.py` → `create_chunks.py` → `merge_chunks.py` → `read_chunks.py`) before starting the API.

**Transcription is very slow**
This is expected on CPU. Consider running overnight for large video collections. Each file is skipped automatically if already transcribed, so you can stop and resume safely.

**LLM response is slow**
LLaMA 3.2 on CPU can take 30–90 seconds per response depending on your hardware. This is normal for local inference without a GPU.

---

## Folder Setup Checklist

Before running the pipeline, make sure this is in place:

- [ ] `videos/` folder exists and contains your `.mp4` lecture files
- [ ] FFmpeg is installed and accessible from terminal
- [ ] Ollama is running with `bge-m3` and `llama3.2` pulled
- [ ] Python dependencies are installed
- [ ] `audios/`, `transcripts/`, and `merged_transcripts/` folders will be created automatically

---
## Future Scope

### 1. GPU Acceleration
The entire pipeline currently runs on CPU. Adding GPU support for Faster-Whisper (`device="cuda"`) and switching to a larger Whisper model (`medium` or `large-v2`) would significantly improve transcription accuracy and speed. Similarly, running BGE-M3 and LLaMA 3.2 with GPU offloading via Ollama would reduce query response time from minutes to seconds.

### 2. Larger and Quantised Language Models
LLaMA 3.2 (3B) was chosen for low-end hardware compatibility. As hardware improves, upgrading to LLaMA 3.1 (8B) or Mistral 7B would produce more detailed and accurate answers.

### 3. Hybrid Search (Keyword + Semantic)
The current retrieval is purely semantic (dense vector search). Adding BM25 keyword search and combining it with cosine similarity through a re-ranker (such as a cross-encoder) would improve results for queries with specific technical terms, variable names, or function names that semantic search alone may miss.

### 4. Multi-Course Support
Currently the system is scoped to a single course. A multi-course architecture would allow students to upload and switch between different subjects. This would require a per-course vector store, a course selection UI, and a routing layer in the Flask API that queries only the relevant embeddings.

### 5. Automatic Slide and PDF Integration
Lecture videos are often accompanied by slides or PDF notes. Integrating PDF parsing (via PyMuPDF or pdfplumber) and embedding slide content alongside video transcripts would give the system a richer knowledge base — allowing it to answer questions that appear in slides but are not spoken aloud in the video.

### 6. Speaker Diarisation
Faster-Whisper does not distinguish between speakers. Adding speaker diarisation (via pyannote.audio) would allow the system to identify when a student asks a question versus when the instructor answers — improving the quality of the transcript and allowing filtered search by speaker role.

### 7. Web-Based Upload Interface
Currently, videos must be manually placed in the `videos/` folder and the pipeline scripts must be run from the terminal. A drag-and-drop web interface for uploading videos and triggering the pipeline automatically would make the system accessible to non-technical users such as educators.

### 8. Summarisation per Video
Each video could be automatically summarised into a set of key topics after transcription. These summaries could be displayed in the frontend as a table of contents, letting users browse what a video covers before asking questions — reducing dependency on exact query wording.

### 9. User Feedback Loop
Adding a thumbs up / thumbs down button on each answer would allow users to flag poor responses. Over time, this feedback could be used to fine-tune the prompt, adjust chunk size, or retrain a re-ranker — turning the system into a self-improving retrieval engine.

### 10. Cloud Deployment
The system is fully local by design. A natural next step would be containerising it with Docker and deploying it on a cloud platform (AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run, or Hugging Face Spaces) with the `.joblib` file stored in an object store like AWS S3 — making it accessible to an entire class rather than just one machine.
